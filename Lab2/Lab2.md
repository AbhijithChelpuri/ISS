# Lab 2: Shell Scripting
*File permissions, patterns in a file*

1. Consider the file “hamlet.txt”. Display all occurrences (case sensitive) of the word “the” in the file. 
2. In the same file, display all the lines in which the word “to” occurs (not as a part of any other word). (Words like 3. “today” should not be present in your output).
4. Display 2 lines below the word “time”.
5. Remove read, write and execute access from the file “hamlet.txt” for group and others using 2 different ways. (symbolic and octal)
6. Allow everyone to read, write but not execute the same file (hamlet.txt), using a single command
7. View all the groups that the current user account is attached to.
8. Change the group owner of the file “hamlet.txt”. (chown)
9. List all the files from your home directory for which group has write permissions. (Hint: piping, grep)

Bash scripts have a .sh extension. After editing a script in an editor, run `chmod +x <script_name>.sh` to give the required
permissions.
We will learn shell scripting through various examples. The scripts are present in the scripts folder for each of the examples.
1. Echo Your name.
2. Print the sum of two numbers passed as arguments.
3. Bubble sort
4. Create a directory called "try". Go into it and create some empty files using touch. Now, write a script to extend the name
of all files in try directory with filename.try. For example, file named xyz becomes xyz.try.
